_About me:_

I'm a 44 y.o. system administrator. I guess each life sphere has some progressive trends and if you want to be  you should take some learning activities for yourself. When I was with Mercedes-Benz I was a initiator of 2 automatization projects: Electronic application accounting system (it's some online system for regulation access to MB service sources) and Electronic equipment accounting system (based on 1C system). In that moment I have wanted to be a front-end developer. So now, I'm on a way. Actually it's not simple for me, but I'm trying and I know I will do it.
